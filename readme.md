Issues with this Repo:


It seems to have been abandoned, perhaps because Google has made Angular2 CLI


I personally would still like a Angular1 CLI


Maybe I will fix this and maintain it? Who knows??


i. ng-core-addons has out of date build dependencies


ii. install latest karma (fix? : "npm install karma karma-jasmine jasmine-core karma-chrome-launcher --save-dev") in project root


iii. path.join in node_modules/ngcli-taskrunner/index.js is funky!
